# Arithmetic operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.

| Operator | Meaning                                                          | Example                    |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| +        | Add two operands or unary plus                                   | 5 + 3 = 8                  |
| -        | Subtract right operand from the left or unary minus              | 5 - 3 = 2                  |
| \*       | Multiply two operands                                            | 5 \* 3 = 15                |
| /        | Divide left operand by the right one (always results into float) | 5 / 3 = 1.6666666666666667 |
| //       | Integer division (results into integer)                          | 5 // 3 = 1                 |
| %        | Modulus - remainder of the division of left operand by the right | 5 % 3 = 2                  |
| \*\*     | Exponentiation - left operand to the power of right operand      | 5 \*\* 3 = 125             |

### Example 1: Arithmetic operators in Python

```python
x = 15
y = 4

# Output: x + y = 19
print(f'x + y = {x+y}')

# Output: x - y = 11
print(f'x - y = {x-y}')

# Output: x * y = 60
print(f'x * y = {x*y}')

# Output: x / y = 3.75
print(f'x / y = {x/y}')

# Output: x // y = 3
print(f'x // y = {x//y}')

# Output: x % y = 3
print(f'x % y = {x%y}')

# Output: x ** y = 50625
print(f'x ** y = {x**y}')
```

### **Output:**

```
x + y = 19
x - y = 11
x * y = 60
x / y = 3.75
x // y = 3
x % y = 3
x ** y = 50625
```

### Addition

This operator is used to add two values present on either side of the operator.

**Input:**

```python
x = 2
y = 3
sum = x + y
print (sum)
```

**Output**

```python:
5
```

### Subtraction

This operator is used to subtract the value present on the right side of the operator from the value present on the left side of the operator.

**Input:**

```python
x = 5
y = 2
sub = x - y
print (sub)
```

**Output:**

```python:
3
```

### Multiplication

This operator is used to find the product of the two values present on either side of the operator.

**Input:**

```python
x = 2
y = 3
mul = x * y
print (mul)
```

**Output:**

```python:
6
```

### Division

This operator is used to find the quotient. The value present on the left side of the operator acts as a Dividend and the one on the right side is Divisor.

**Input:**

```python
x = 5
y = 2
div = x / y
print (div)
```

**Output:**

```python:
2.5
```

A division operation always results in a floating-point number.

### Modulus

This operator is used to find the remainder. The value present on the left side of the operator acts as a Dividend and the one on the right side is Divisor.

**Input:**

```python
x = 8
y = 3
mod = x % y
print (mod)

a = -5
b = 2
res1 = a % b
print (res1)

m = 5
n = -2
res2 = m % n
print (res2)
```

**Output:**

```python:
2
1
-1
```

The sign of the result of the modulus operator (`%`) in Python is always the same as the sign of the *divisor*. For example, `a % n` will have the same sign as `n`.

### Exponentiation

This operator is used to raise the first value to the power of the second operator

**Input:**

```python
x = 2
y = 3
exp = x ** y
print (exp)
```

**Output:**

```python:
8
```

### Floor division

The Floor Division operator is used to floor the result to the nearest integer.

**Input:**

```python
x = 5
y = 2
flo = x // y
print (flo)
```

**Output:**

```python:
2
```

### Order of precedence of Arithmetic operators in Python

Arithmetic Operators in Python follow a basic order of precedence.
When more than one operator is used, they are executed according to this order:

| Operator     | Purpose                                             |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| ()           | Parentheses                                         |
| \*\*         | Exponentiation                                      |
| %, \*, /, // | Modulus, Multiplication, Division, Integer Division |
| +, -         | Addition, Subtraction                               |

> **Note:** The operator listed at the top of the table will be executed first.

**Input:**

```python
print (((5 + 4) / 3) * 2)
```

**Output:**

```python:
6.0
```

Here, as you can see according to the order of precedence, Parentheses will be computed first. So inside the innermost parenthesis, there is an addition operator.
