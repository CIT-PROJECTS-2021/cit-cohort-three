  This week we will learn about data structures and algorithms. We will learn how
  to use them to solve problems and how to implement them in code.

A computer program is a collection of instructions to perform a specific task. For this, a computer program may need to store data, retrieve data, and perform computations on the data.

A data structure is a named location that can be used to store and organize data. And, an algorithm is a collection of steps to solve a particular problem. Learning data structures and algorithms allow us to write efficient and optimized computer programs.

this DSA lecture will guide you to learn different types of data structures and algorithms and their implementations in Python.
